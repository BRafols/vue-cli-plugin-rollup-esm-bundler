# Vue CLI 3.0 plugin with Rollup ESM Bundler (Under Construction)

- Plugin coming soon!
- Readme coming soon!

### Notes:

- Rollup config (for example whether css should be inlined or not) should be configurable by the user via prompts.
- Should import the component to the App in order to see it at start. Should remove HelloWorld and add only this
  component
- Need to validate kebab case / pascal case inputs.
- Whatever input comes, convert it to PascalCase at the beginning

### Acknowledgements:

- This plugin is inspired from [vue-sfc-rollup](https://github.com/team-innovation/vue-sfc-rollup)
